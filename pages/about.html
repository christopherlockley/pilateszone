            <h3>About Me</h3>

        </div>
        <div class="right-about">
            <p>I did not start out in the fitness industry. For almost 40 years, I was a health professional working as a nurse, midwife, health visitor and public health specialist within the NHS. At the age of 7 years, I was diagnosed with juvenile arthritis. In those days, the treatment was merely to 'rest', and as a result I was not allowed to take part in any physical activity sessions at school. But as we now know, all this led to was a stiffening of joints! Fortunately, when I reached senior school, the diagnosis stopped following me around. I took up every sport available, including running which I still do today. I am never likely to break any world records, but as a very keen (if increasingly slower) runner I have completed numerous half, full, and ultra marathons both in the UK and abroad. I also love cycling and used to commute to and from work every day on a less-than-ideal (and somewhat slow) hybrid bicycle. In 2016 I completed my first triathlon. But as I've never been blessed with height, I managed to get stuck in the pool as there were no steps to climb out from! I managed to come fourth from last but I had a massive smile plastered across my face. I loved every minute of it!

                As a runner I know only too well the benefits of Pilates and the way regular Pilates has enabled me to maintain flexibility over the years. I am passionate about encouraging others to maintain their health and fitness levels and showing them how they too can build physical activity into their day to day life.
               
               I retrained as a Pilates Teacher and obtained the Diploma in Pilates in 2017.
               
               My hope is that others will take up the new challenge of Pilates and grow to love it as much as I do.
