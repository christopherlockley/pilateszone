    <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
    <p>
        Upon booking with The Pilates Zone, you agree to the terms and conditions outlined below.<br><br>
     
        
        <em>1.</em> By taking part in a Pilates class with Dawn at The Pilates Zone, you fully understand that your teacher is not liable for any injuries sustained during classes. You agree to take responsibility for your own body, to be honest with yourself and your teacher about any conditions or current areas of pain you may be experiencing, and not to perform any exercises or movements that may cause or exacerbate discomfort. You confirm that you are fit and able to join the class, and that the health questionnaire (available for download via The Pilates Zone website) is completed prior to undertaking any classes. You must ensure that you are working in a safe environment and that you are able to clearly see and/or hear your teacher in order to follow instructions. It is your responsibility to let the teacher know before the class if you have any injuries or anything which will affect your ability to exercise that day. 
        Of course, owing to the knowledge of your instructor, Dawn, she will be able to guide you with exercises that will not exacerbate or cause any pain or injury, but you must inform her if any of the exercises are causing discomfort. 
        By joining the class you automatically agree to waive all statutory rights against your teacher. <br><br>
        
        <em>2.</em> Currently, the minimum purchase for our Pilates classes is a block booking of six sessions. If you book a block and miss a session for any reason, you are able to join one of the other groups on the same day in a subsequent week. However, please provide as much notice as possible if you believe you will be unable to attend a particular session. If you cancel less than 6 hours before a class, we will not be able to offer you a place on the same day in a subsequent week. Please remember that your space in any missed session will remain empty if you cannot attend.<br><br>
        
        <em>3.</em> Whether you attend or not, The Pilates Zone is liable for the full payment of rent. Consequently, it is important that payments to Dawn at The Pilates Zone are made in a timely manner. If payment is not received prior to the start of your block, it will be assumed that you no longer require your place and, as such, we reserve the right to offer your place to another individual on the waiting list. We are, however, human, and understand that you may encounter financial difficulties. If this is the case and you would still like to attend, please inform Dawn of your situation and we will endeavour to arrange a date by which payment shall be made.<br><br>
        
       <em>4.</em>If you miss a session and are not able to attend a subsequent week's class, we are unable to provide a refund for said session owing to the cost of renting the studio space.<br><br>
        
        <em>5.</em>Should The Pilates Zone cancel a session for any reason, we will offer either a refund for the session (at a pro-rata rate to which you paid) or provide you with the opportunity to join a different class. Alternatively, if you are unable to join one of the additional classes, we can subtract the pro-rata cost of the missed session from your next block booking should you prefer. At the current block price of £49, this would equate to a future block price of £40.84 (subject to change).<br><br>
        
       <em>6.</em>By joining our classes, you agree to behave in a respectful, kind, and inclusivem manner. Should an attending member cause disruption which affects others from receiving professional tuition, we reserve the right to serve a notice (following a verbal warning) asking said attendee to leave. Refunds will not be provided for the remaining sessions in your block.<br><br>
        
        <em>7.</em>If attending one of The Pilates Zones' online Pilates classes, you fully understand and agree that your teacher is unable to offer any personal correction. As above, you agree to take responsibility for your own body, and not to perform any exercises or movements that may cause you discomfort. Additionally, you confirm that you are fit and able to join the class, subject to approval following the completion of the requisite health questionnaire. You must ensure that you are working in a safe environment and that you are able to clearly see and/or hear your teacher in order to follow instructions. It is your responsibility to let the teacher know before the class if you have any injuries or anything which will affect your ability to exercise that day. By joining the class you automatically agree to waive all statutory rights against your teacher.<br><br>
        
       <em>8.</em>In the interest of personal safety, it is imperative that members join classes and warm up as instructed within the first 10 minutes of a class starting. Entry to classes will not be allowed after this period as warm ups are an essential tool for avoiding injury!<br><br>
        
        <em>9.</em> Six week sessions reduce the overall cost of your training. Refunds are offered in line with <em>Term 5</em>, but the terms laid out in <em>Term 2</em> apply if you miss a class for any reason.<br><br>
        
       <em>10.</em>It is imperative that you have a one to one session with your teacher, Dawn, and that the health questionnaire (downloadable from our website) is completed in full before attending any group classes.<br><br>
        
       <em>11.</em> Owing to the conditions laid out in <em>Term 10</em>, we do not currently offer drop in sessions.<br><br>
        
        <em>12.</em>Upon deciding to book a 6-week block, payment must be received within 7 days. If payment is not received within 7 days, we reserve the right to offer your space to another member on the waiting list. The Pilates Zone's classes are in high demand, and there is currently a lengthy waiting list - so please ensure you pay on time so as to not miss out!</p>
