    <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
    <p><em>Terms and Conditions.</em>

        Upon booking with The Pilates Zone, you agree to the terms and conditions outlined below.
        
        Disclaimer:
        
        By taking part in a Pilates class with Dawn at The Pilates Zone, you fully understand that your teacher is not able to offer any personal correction; you agree to take responsibility for your own body; you agree not to perform any exercises or movements that may cause you discomfort; and you confirm that you are fit and able to join the class. You must ensure that you are working in a safe environment and that you are able to clearly see and/or hear your teacher in order to follow instructions. It is your responsibility to let the teacher know before the class if you have any injuries or anything which will affect your ability to exercise that day. 
        By joining the class you automatically agree to waive all statutory rights against your teacher.
        
        Currently, the minimum purchase for our Pilates classes is a block booking of six sessions. If you book a block and miss a session you are able to join one of the other groups on the same day in a subsequent week. Please remember that your space in any missed session will remain empty if you cannot attend.
        
        Whether you attend or not, The Pilates Zone is liable for the full payment of rent. Consequently, it is important that payments to Dawn at The Pilates Zone are made in a timely manner. If payment is not received prior to the start of your block, it will be assumed that you no longer require your place and, as such, we reserve the right to offer your place to another individual on the waiting list. We are, however, human, and understand that you may encounter financial difficulties. If this is the case and you would still like to attend, please inform Dawn of the situation and arrange a date by which payment will be made.
        
        If you miss a session and are not able to attend a subsequent week's class, we are unable to provide a refund for said session owing to the cost of renting the studio space.
        
        Should The Pilates Zone cancel a session due to unforeseen circumstances, we will offer either a refund for the session (at a pro-rata rate to which you paid) or provide you with the opportunity to join a different available class. Alternatively, we can subtract the pro-rata cost of the missed session from your next block booking should you prefer. At the current block price of £49, this would equate to a future block price of £40.84.
        
        Disruption, Under our terms and conditions should an attending member cause disruption which affects others from receiving professional tuition we shall serve a notice asking that member to leave and any unattended classes shall be refunded in full.

        Payment. Upon notification that the 6 week session is due for payment, it MUST be received within 7 days.After 7 days it will be presumed that you no longer want your place and it will be re-issued to those on the waiting list.</p>
