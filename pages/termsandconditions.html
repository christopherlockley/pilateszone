        Currently, the minimum purchase for our Pilates classes is a block booking of six sessions.Please note that we pay rent for your space whether or not you attend. If payment is not received prior to the start of the classes it will be assumed that you no longer require your place and it will be offered to those waiting for a place unless alternative arrangements are made beforehand.
        
        If you book a block and, for whatever reason, you are unable to attend your usual class, you can join any of the other classes we run subject to availability. If an alternative class is offered and you decline to attend, you will effectively lose the value of that session. The value of the missed session cannot be used against your next six-week block.
